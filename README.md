# multigw
This repository is a repository that stores python3 script data which aims to Generate Gmail DotTrick/CapitalTrick, as well as helping users of blockchain networks like EVM and most others 

For run the script you must install some following dependency
1. git
2. python/python3
3. pip install -r requirements.txt

so all material for war you have.
next for run :
1. git clone https://github.com/Shenzoni/multigw
2. cd multigw
3. python main.py

if you need to try use " BATCH SENDER " you must create file private.csv/batchpk.csv first, because for batch sender/burn menu you must have the private.csv/batchpk.csv file for run and you can paste your PrivateKey on private.csv/batchpk.csv

for example :
A. you need to send 1>100
_so you need file private.csv_
**_in this file you have to enter 1 private keys for the purpose of sending the main token (ETH) to 100 wallet)_**

B. you need to send 100>1
_so you need file batchpk.csv_
**_in this file you have to enter 100 private keys for the purpose of sending the main token (ETH) to 1 wallet)_**

if you need to try use " BATCH BURN " you must create file burnpk.csv
**_in this file you have to enter 100 private keys for the purpose of sending the main token (SOL) after burn to 1 wallet)_**

i hope you love with my script
